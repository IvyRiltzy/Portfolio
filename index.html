  <h1>Hi, I'm Ivy Ngari</h1>
  <p>
    I have a background in Medical Biochemistry and recently, I developed an interest in software developing. It is my fourth month in and I am loving the progress. This journey has not been easy, especially because I have to learn new terminologies that I have never heard of. All I can say in overall is <i> I love it here.<i>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a self-taught developer from Kenya passionate about building user-friendly websites. I enjoy learning new technologies and bringing ideas to life through code. My goal is to design science related software that might be of help to students and teachers alike. I also aim to pursue a career as a full-time developer and that is because I enjoy the development process. I believe that a career should be something that gives you purpose, and for me this might be it!
